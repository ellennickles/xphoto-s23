# Week 2 • Single Camera

> The task of the cinema and of the camera is not to imitate the human eye, but to see and record what the human eye normally does not see… The camera can function independently, can see in ways that [a human] is not accustomed to--can suggest new points of view and demonstrate how to look at things differently. ([Osip Brik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osip_Brik), “What the Eye Does Not See”, 1926)

## Questions
- How can we take photographs on our computers in p5.js (p5) using built-in and external webcams?
- What are ways to read and talk about photographs? 
- What are ways to provide feedback on each other’s work that express our interest and curiosity and to promote awareness and discovery in the choices we all make as photographers?

## Assignment due night of Mon Feb 6
[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#grading) 

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT
- The goal this week is to get used to using our laptops to make pictures. It might feel unusual or awkward at first, but the computer and p5 provide opportunities to design our own camera systems. We’ll build on the features over the next few weeks. Play and get to know this image-making device.
- Pick an object at home that you love. 
- Ideally, connect an external camera and use a separate application to adjust the settings to black and white (see [External Webcams / Apps / Tips](https://tinyurl.com/externalwebcams)).
- Take at least **36 different black and white photographs** of it using your computer’s built-in camera or an external webcam. (Why black and white? Why 36?)
- Each photograph should be visually distinct. Use the [Elements of a Photograph]() (link TBA on Tues Feb 2) from class this week if you need inspiration. 
- Post a link to your code and the images on your blog and write a short reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you like the images? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph]() link TBA on Tues Feb 2)? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND
- The “decisive moment” is a recurring idea in photography. Read the Introduction to *The Decisive Moment* by Henri Cartier-Bresson (1952) and an "Interview with Henri Cartier-Bresson from Famous Photographers Tell How (1958)" on American Suburb-X. 
- Select a photograph from the book, *The Decisive Moment* (video content warning: nudity) that exemplifies this idea for you. Take a screenshot of the selected picture, add it to your blog post, and answer all of the questions in [Looking at Photographs]() (link TBA), including why it represents a "decisive moment" to you, to practice reading the elements of a photograph. HINT: Drop your screenshot into a Google Image Search to find a better version? 
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

## Prepare for Weeks 4-5 
- Starting Tue Feb 14 we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last minute if you need to order anything.
- Gather the following materials:
    - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
    - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
    - Solderless breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
    - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
    - The [ITP/IMA Shop](https://shop.itp.io/) has some Arduinos and accessories available to check out
- Install the following apps:
    - [Arduino IDE v2.0 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (older versions should also work)
- Configure and test the IDE with your Aduino:
   - [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-avr)
   - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-samd)
