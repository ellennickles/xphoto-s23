# Week 9 •  Generative Images 1 (Datasets)

>Machine learning is programming with examples, not instructions. (Kyle McDonald, *[Weird Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/304110435)*, KIKK Festival 2018)

## Questions

- What are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and how do they generate
  images?
- Using tools that are familiar to us in this class, what are some ways to
  create and prepare large image datasets to train a GAN?

## Assignment due night of Mon Apr 3

[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#overview-of-assignments)

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT

- Create a dataset of ~1000+ images (1000-5000 is better), but at least 1000
  minimum. More images in your dataset requires more model training time but
  will likely increase the "clarity" of your generated images. Prepare your
  images according to the [Dataset Considerations / Checklist](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZsxQZw4lYvA0EZVZCsQtCCMyQQYL6t8U8qi3swDlwg/edit#slide=id.g21d17960809_0_356).
- Depending on your goal, creating and preparing an image dataset of this size
  can take time; in other words, start well before the night the assignment is
  due.
- Store your dataset in Google Drive and provide a link to it from your blog
  post.
- Also a save a local copy of the entire dataset in a folder on your computer so
  that it is ready to use in class next week to practice training a GAN.
- Write a short reflection about your image choices, your process, results, and
  any questions that came up for you.

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND

- Read "In the Age of A.I., Is Seeing Still Believing?" by Joshua Rothman, *New
  Yorker*, November 12, 2018 Issue.
- The photo-forensics expert in this article explains that, "Modern digital
  cameras...often achieve higher resolutions by guessing about the light their
  sensors don’t catch. 'Essentially, they cheat... Two-thirds of the image isn’t
  recorded—it’s synthesized!'" Some questions to ponder: At such a high
  percentage, is the difference between a photograph taken with a modern digital
  camera and one that is completely computer-generated significant? If it looks
  like a photograph and functions like a photograph, then does it matter how it
  was made? *Is seeing still believing?* What makes a photograph "trustworthy"?
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

## Prepare for Next Week

- Next week we will use Google Colaboratory, or Colab, to run code in the
  browser to train a machine learning model to generate images. For our
  purposes, our Colab account requires a Google Drive plan with a large amount
  of storage space, which we already have through NYU (at least through 2024).
- **Highly recommended!** Log into your NYU Google Drive account, then sign up
  for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/signup). Google Colab Pro
  is highly recommended at $10.88 per month with taxes. This is a monthly
  recurring charge, but the subscription is easy to cancel at any time.
- We will only use Colab for one week, however you might decide to continue to
  use it for your final project.
