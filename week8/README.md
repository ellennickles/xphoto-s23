# Week 8 • Automatic Photomontage

>...since captured, "painted," and synthesized pixel values can be combined seamlessly, the digital image blurs the customary distinctions between painting and photography and between mechanical and handmade pictures. A digital image may be part scanned photograph, part computer-synthesized shaded perspective, and part electronic "painting"--all smoothly melded into an apparently coherent whole. It may be fabricated from found files, disk litter, the detritus of cyberspace. Digital imagers give meaning and value to computational readymades by appropriation, transformation, reprocessing, and recombination; we have entered the age of electrobriocollage. (William J. Mitchell, *The Reconfigured Eye: Visual Truth in the Post-Photographic Era*, 4th printing, 2001)
