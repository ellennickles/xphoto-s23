# Week 6 • Networked Images 1

>Our sense of spatial and temporal orientation has changed dramatically in recent years, prompted by new technologies of surveillance, tracking, and targeting. One of the symptoms of this transformation is the growing importance of aerial views: overviews, Google Map views, satellite views. We are growing increasingly accustomed to what used to be called a God’s-eye view. On the other hand, we also notice the decreasing importance of a paradigm
of visuality that long dominated our vision: linear perspective. Its stable and
single point of view is being supplemented (and often replaced) by multiple
perspectives, overlapping windows, distorted flight lines, and divergent
vanishing points. (Hito Steyerl, "In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical
Perspective," _The Wretched of the Screen_, 2012)
)

## Questions

- What are ways to photograph the world through online-accessible open webcams
  and satellite and street view maps?
- Compared to the last few weeks, do these new tools change our act of
  seeing?

## Assignment due night of Mon Mar 6

[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#overview-of-assignments)

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT

- Pick a theme and curate a collection of at least ten (10) images from
  satellite and/or street view maps and/or open webcams. Be intentional and
  critical about why you are selecting the images and how you arrange them. How
  does grouping these particular images alter or extend their meanings when they are presented together as a set instead of separately?
- Possible inspiration
  - Examples in the class [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO)
  - Maybe your subject matter is a narrative (fictional or real) or documentation of site, event, or a question?
- Not sure which images to include in your collection? Refer to [Is it alive? On
  seeing what is right in front of you...](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/is-it-alive.md)
  by Joanne Dugan for some ideas.
- Post the images on your blog. Again, you can configure them as you see fit for
  the work on your blog. Write a short reflection on your process and
  results. What do the images show? Why do you like the image? What qualities
  do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))?
  If you're working in color, how are you considering color choices? What did
  you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the
  experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising,
  enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND

- Two (2) readings
  - Read "Classified Content" by Mimi Ọnụọha
  - Read “The Pig and the Algorithm)” by Kate Palmer Albers
- Respond
  - In your own words, what is the main message or argument of each essay? How
    are they similar or different in their messages? What evidence or examples
    does each author use to support their argument? Why do you think we are
    reading these pieces? How might they be relevant to our experiments with
    networked images?
- Question
  - Next week [Alexey Yurenev](https://www.yurenev.com/) will visit to share
    his project, Silent Hero. Watch the video about the project (~17 min) and
    prepare at least one (1) question for discussion. **Please note that this
    project relates to Weeks 9 and 10 of our course.**
