# Week 3 • Multiple Cameras

>A photograph, while recording what has been seen, always and by its nature refers to what is not seen. It isolates, preserves, and presents a moment taken from a continuum…. The only decision [the photographer] can take is as regards the moment [they] choose to isolate. Yet this apparent limitation gives the photograph its unique power. What it shows invokes what is not shown. (John Berger, *Understanding a Photograph*, 1968)

## Questions

- How can we use our [Questions for Discovery](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/questions-for-discovery.md) as tools to draw awareness to and articulate how we read photographs?
- What is Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment”?
- How does that idea compare to Nick Waplington's "indecisive memento"?
- How can we work with multiple cameras in p5 to capture a moment from multiple angles simultaneously?

## Assignment due night of Wed Feb 15

[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#overview-of-assignments)

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT
- Capture multiple images of a scene from **at least two (2) to three (3) different angles** (or more!) simultaneously and in **black and white**. 
- Maybe play with cause and effect, action and reaction, before and after? Or something completely different. Is the scene from a story, a mystery, a sensation? Is it a spontaneous or planned event? Consider the five senses, e.g. is it a loud moment or a quiet one? Decisive or indecisive?
- Consider how you want to display the final photographs. The arrangement can be
  completely different from how you drew the photos to the Canvas at the moment
  of capture, i.e. you can configure them as you see fit for the work on your
  blog.
- Post the images on your blog along with a link to your code and write a short reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you like the images? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND

- Read “The Annihilation of Time and Space” in *River of Shadows* by Rebecca Solnit, pp. 1-24  
- Did anything surprise you about this reading? What do you want to know more about? It's been about 150 years since Muybridge’s Horse in Motion series, and now electricity and photography are ubiquitous. What currently emerging technologies do you predict could become prevelant in the future? 
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

## Prepare for **Next Week** and Week 5

- Starting Tue Feb 14 we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last minute if you need to order anything.
- Gather the following materials:
  - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
  - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
  - Solderless breadboard
  - Jumper wires
  - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
  - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
  - The [ITP/IMA Shop](https://shop.itp.io/) has some Arduinos and accessories available to check out
- Install the following apps:
  - [Arduino IDE v2.0 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (older versions should also work)
- Configure and test the IDE with your Aduino:
  - [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-avr)
  - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-samd)
