### Preparing for user testing next week

- Next week (Week 13) is a opportunity to share a version of your project for
  feedback.
- Observing how others engage with your project is an incredibly valuable part
  of the design process to understand what’s working (and not) in order to
  improve the experience. Sometimes unexpected user questions and interactions
  provide new insights for developing projects in entirely different directions.
- It's up to you to design your user testing. It can mean something different
  for each project. For example, it might be more obvious what to do for a
  website or a publication vs a physical installation. If you are not sure how
  to design your testing, let me know and we'll figure out some options.
- When testing, show rather than tell your idea as much as possible. The *rule*
  that we’ll try to adhere to is no explaining of the project until after the
  user has viewed or interacted with it. So if possible, no special instructions
  to testers before they start.
- But! If your project is meant for a specific context or audience, then state
  the minimal amount of information, e.g. where ideally would this project be
  experienced and who is your audience/user base? (Note that everyone or anyone
  is not a user base.)

### PART 1 • CREATE A FINAL PROJECT PROTOTYPE

- Come to class with a version of your project to share.
- If you are working on a sequence or series of photographs, bring a rough draft
  along with other options you are considering including.
- If your project is a publication, bring a mock-up.
- If your project is screen-based, be prepared to share a live sketch/site,
  full-screen if possible.
- If your project involves some type of physical interaction, ideally bring it
  to class if you can or show a short video (~2 min)

### PART 2 • DOCUMENT YOUR PROGRESS AND USER TESTING PLAN

- Write a blog post about the current state of your project. Note any
  breakthroughs, frustrations, questions, challenges, additional resources that
  you are using or need.
- Include your plan for user testing next week. Figure out what you want to get
  out of the session (see above). Prepare some open-ended questions for your
  testers that focus on specific aspects of your project that you’re unsure of
  or want to know more about, e.g. “What did you take away from this project?”
  versus “Do you get that my project is about XYZ?​”
- If you are working in a group, each person needs to contribute and submit a
  post documenting their contributions.
- This assignment is worth five (5) points: two (2) for describing your
  project's progress, two (2) for describing your user testing plan and
  questions, and one (1) for submitting the post on time.
