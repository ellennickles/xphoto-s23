# Week 5 • Alternative Shutter Buttons 2

>When I ask him what’s the first thing he notices when looking back at his photographs, [William] Eggleston again says nothing for a long time. I sit back and watch him, leaving him to think. Eventually, he answers, “I try to study everything about the thing, from every angle,” he places his hand vertically across the page, and then, pointing to different sections, “the way colours work against no colour – those black-and-white areas – which is very important. The subject could be anything. A picture gives it life. As though if it didn’t exist on the page, it would be less.” ("[Looking at Pictures with William Eggleston](https://artreview.com/ar-may-2019-feature-william-eggleston/)," Fi Churchman interview with William Eggleston, ArtReview, May 2019)

## Questions

- How can we start to purposely add color to our images?
- What are additional ways to work with sensors as alternative shutter buttons?

## Assignment due night of Wed Mar 1

[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#overview-of-assignments)

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT (PARTNERS OPTIONAL)

- Continue to work with sensor triggers and take a series of images, but add
  color this week. **Be deliberate about your color choices and placement in the
  composition(s)**. Focus on one dominant color or work with a color scheme (check [our Miro board](https://tinyurl.com/xphoto-s23-miro) for reference).
- Work with the same sensor, a new one, or several at time. Continue to consider: how is triggering the capture the result of a change (or inactivity) in the environment or an action (or reaction) of the body? Is the triggering active or passive? How does the choice of sensor and its context in the world contribute to the intentions or expressions of the image? The only rule is: no buttons or toggle switches on your Arduino to trigger captures.
- Choose one of the images to post on your blog. Write a short reflection on your process and results. What does the image show? Why do you like the image? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? Why and how are you using color? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- If you work with a partner, each person needs to submit a blog post.

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND

- Two (2) readings
  - Read "The Changing Gaze: From Documentary Photography to Voyeurism to
  Surveillance" by Ann-Christin Bertrand
  - Read “The Machine Sensorium” by James Bridle
- Respond
  - Both of these essays are from the exhibition catalog accompanying, [_Watched!
  Surveillance, Art & Photography_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCVnV7Vl7HE)
  (2016). Using examples in these two readings, describe the changing nature
  of the "photographic gaze". Consider the role of distance, public and private
  conditions, power relations, "persistance of vision" (Bridle), the
  information/data an image contains, and the contexts in which images are made
  and distributed (Bertrand).
  - What is your response to the idea that non-human operated remote cameras are
  more "objective" and "authentic"? Is your response informed by your own
  relationship to surveillance practices (visual and non-visual)? If so, how?
- Question
  - Next week artist [Jason Isolini](https://jisolini.com) will visit and share
    his work with our class. Review and interact(!) with his project, [The Ballard
    of a Laborer](https://jisolini.com/#/ballad-of-loosii-ninjas/), and come up
    with at least one (1) question for discussion.
