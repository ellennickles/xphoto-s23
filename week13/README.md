### PART 1 • COMPLETE YOUR FINAL PROJECT

### PART 2 • FINAL DOCUMENTATION

Write your final project documentation in the form of a blog post. It's up to
you to figure out how to best document your project. Here are some loose
guidelines if you aren't sure what to include:

- **Title** and one-sentence description
- **Link** to project (if online)
- **Project summary** • 250-500 words
- **Inspiration** • How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes,
  photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills,
  etc.
- **Process** • How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What
  were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
- **Audience/context** • Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it
  interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke
  something?
- **Code references** • What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project?
- **Next steps** • If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
- If the project is a collaboration, each person is expected to submit a post
  documenting their contributions.

### PART 3 • PREPARE A PRESENTATION

- Prepare a five (5)-min presentation about your project. Feel free to include
  any questions to direct feedback after your presentation.  
- If your project is online, be prepared to share a link.
- If your project is a physical object, please bring it to class.
- If your project involves physical interaction, prepare a short video (~2 min)
  of the experience as a backup.
- HINT: Use your final documentation blog post as an outline.

This assignment is worth ten (10) points: five (5) for the project implementation and five (5) for the documentation and presentation.
