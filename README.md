### Course Description
What are all the ways that you saw or made a photograph this
week? How are those ways similar and different? How do those
pictures function in your life and in society? What is a
photograph? This course repeatedly asks these questions by
using emerging computational tools to design alternative forms
of making and interacting with photographs. The forms and
applications of these tools, such as those for creative coding,
physical computing, and machine learning, are explored weekly
in technical tutorials and hands-on workshops. These are
informed by discussions of critical debates in photography and
by various practitioners working with photographs, past and
present. The homework includes reading, short writing
responses, and photography assignments. Prerequisites: IMA’s
introductory courses, Creative Computing (or similar
coursework with coding and microcontrollers) and Comm Lab:
HyperCinema (or similar coursework exploring communication
and storytelling with digital tools).

### Learning Objectives
At the completion of this course, we will be able to
1. describe the creative potential of emerging computational technologies in photography;
2. discuss historical and contemporary ideas about photography, including its tools and uses in the cultural landscape;
3. respond to these ideas by experimenting with the expressive possibilities of creative coding techniques, sensors, and machine learning models; 
4. create alternative ways to engage in photographic practices using these digital tools.

### Format
Experimental Photography is a 14-week course that meets twice a week in person at the scheduled times. Class time is structured as a mixture of homework review, discussion, group work, lecture, demonstrations, and hands-on tutorials. There are reading, writing, and creative assignments to do before each class. You are expected to come to class with an open-mind, curiosity, questions, a laptop, and any other supplies specified for the individual dates on the schedule.

For the most part each week is organized into two parts. One class will be devoted to homework review to reflect on our work, develop our visual literacy skills (reading and interpreting images), and co-create a visual learning experience. The other class will be dedicated to technical workshops to introduce new techniques to apply in our creative practices. In the mix will be lectures and discussions about photography history and photographers, as well as in-class activities to further engage with the ideas presented in the course.

### Community Guidelines
In keeping with the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index), this course is committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in our community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content. 

**Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces**
<br>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use requested pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however, our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor.

### Communication 
During class, we will use [our Miro board](https://tinyurl.com/xphoto-s23-miro), a free and online whiteboard with chat functionality to take notes, collaborate, and share links and our photographs. 

Outside of class:
- You are expected to check your NYU email frequently for course-related information, including but not limited to general announcements and updates. Please feel free to email me with any questions or concerns any time.
- Student Hours will take place in person (near Design Lab) or on Zoom. [Sign up here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUJBXzVpUFp3azhlfGRlZmF1bHR8MDk4NDA1OWMzNzEyMThhZjVkMTgzYWI3YmUxMWNmY2M) 
- Expect to submit your assignments using a Google Form.
- I'll provide assignment feedback on individually-shared Google documents.
- Our course site is hosted here on GitHub with links to resources private to our class in Google Drive.

When in doubt, it’s ALWAYS better to contact me sooner rather than later about attendance, assignments, or anything else on your mind.

### Support
I want you to succeed! If you ever feel that you are struggling with the material or falling behind, please do not hesitate to reach out to me so we can work together to ensure that you have proper support.

Here are additional forms of support at IMA:
- Look out for the ITP/IMA residents' [office hours](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/office-hours/).
- Visit [The Coding Lab](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/in-person-help/coding-lab/) to ask ITP student mentors about code.

Tips for asking for technical help:
- Clearly describe what you want to happen and what is happening instead.
- Give enough information in order for someone to recreate the problem.
- Ideally, provide a link to the code itself.

### Equipment
#### Software - !!! UPDATE !!! 
At the time of this writing, our class will use the following free applications:
- [Miro](https://tinyurl.com/xphoto-s23-miro), our interactive whiteboard for taking notes and sharing our photographs
- [p5.js (p5)](https://editor.p5js.org/), [ml5.js (ml5)](https://ml5js.org/), [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) v2.0 or later but older versions should also work
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or code editor of your choice)
- NYU’s Google Workspace
- Stability AI's [Stable Diffusion 2.1 Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) or [DreamStudio Lite](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai)
- !!! UPDATE !!! (Optional) Apps to adjust Logitech webcam settings
- (Optional) [Iriun](https://iriun.com/) to use your phone's camera as a wireless webcam in your PC or Mac
- (Week 9) We will also use Google Colaboratory, or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), to run code in the browser to train a machine learning model to generate images. A Colab account requires a Google account with a large Google Drive plan, which we already have through NYU; I advise you to create your Colab account through your NYU Google account.
    - At the time of this writing three different Colab plans are available: Free, Pro ($9.99 / month), and Pro+ ($49.99 / month). 
    - I highly recommend subscribing to the Colab Pro plan at $9.99 / month when we need it. We will only use Colab for one week, however you may decide to continue to use it for your final project.
    - Monthly subscriptions are easy to cancel at any time. 
    - Access to machine learning resources are increasingly available, and as such, this information is subject to change by the time the course begins.
- (Optional) You are welcome to use image editing software, such as Photoshop or Lightroom, to post-process the photographs that you make. These programs are available as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, which NYU provides free of charge. See the [Tisch Adobe Creative Cloud User Guide](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/free-copy-of-adobe/). 

#### Hardware
##### Computers
You will need a modern laptop. Four years old or younger is a good rule of thumb. Limited numbers are available for checkout from the ITP/IMA Equipment Room (ER) and must be returned by the end of the day.

##### Cameras
- (Weeks 2-3) We will use external camera devices with our laptops. USB Logitech webcams will be demonstrated in class, and I will check out a class set of cameras from the ER for our class to use. Additional cameras are available to check out from the ER for 24-hour reservations.
- If your computer only has USB-C ports, then you will also need a **USB to USB-C adapter** to connect a Logitech webcam. **Please note: your adapter must be able to transmit data as well as power the camera.** These are also available from the ER, but they can be in high demand and sometimes unavailable to check out. Consider sharing with your classmates or purchasing your own: packs of 2 for ~$10 or less are frequently available on Amazon.

##### Physical Computing
- (Weeks 4-5) If you're an IMA student, expect to use the Arduino kit you acquired for your Creative Computing class. Depending on when you took Creative Computing, this might include an Arduino Uno or Nano 33 IoT. Either one will work. Arduino Unos, Nano 33 IoTs, and Nano 33 BLE Senses (which will also work) are listed as available to check out from The Shop.
- I recommend using sensors that you already have and with which you have previous experience. The Shop also provides some sensors to check out.
- For general information on electronic components, sensors, their availability at ITP/IMA, and where to purchase them see the [ITP Physical Computing Parts and Tools Guide](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/resources/parts-and-tools-guide/).

### Participation and Attendance
#### Participation
This class is highly participatory, and there are many ways to demonstrate your engagement with the course material and with your peers:
- show up on time with curiosity;
- ask and answer questions;
- share your photography experiments for group review;
- take part in your classmates’ review sessions;
- contribute to class discussions (use the weekly reading responses to prepare);
- participate in group activities;
- support and help your fellow classmates during discussions and technical workshops;
- unless otherwise directed, stow your phone away and mute any notificatiions unrelated to class;

#### Absences
Attendance is mandatory. If you think you will be absent, please contact me before class unless circumstances make this truly impossible. If you're feeling unwell, please know that I do not require any proof from a medical office, and I will excuse your absence. At most one (1) unexcused absence will be tolerated without affecting your grade. Any more than one (1) unexcused absence will result in a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, two (2) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Five (5) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course. 

#### Lateness
You are expected to arrive to class on time and be ready to start at 10:40am ET. An unexcused lateness of ten (10) minutes or more is equivalent to half (1/2) of one absence. Two (2) late arrivals will count as one (1) unexcused absence. 

### Overview of Assignments
All assignments are required, and unless otherwise stated, are **due the night before our class meets**, one (1) week after they are assigned. Assignments turned in late, up to one (1) week, will receive partial credit, as described in the Grading section below. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the assignment deadlines, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together. 

It is expected that you will spend six to eight (6-8) hours a week on the course outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading and/or watching videos, writing responses to the readings, and completing the photography experiments and reflections. Please budget your time accordingly.

#### Weekly Homework
There are two assignments each week:
1. **Photography experiment and reflection**: A creative exercise to explore the possibilities of various technical and conceptual decisions in our photography practices. You are expected to post your photographs on your blog, a link to your code (if applicable), and write a short (100 words minimum) reflection about your experience. The intention of these reflections is to help you develop an awareness of your creative choices over time and note any technical complications. 
2. **Written reading response**: A short (200 words minimum) written response in the form of a blog post to the assigned reading and prompt. The intention of these responses is to provide you with the opportunity to consider the course content at your own pace and in your own words, and to prepare for upcoming, related in-class discussions and activities. 

You are welcome to combine both parts into one blog post. Check the [Schedule and Assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#schedule-and-assignments) above for links to specific homework descriptions, due dates, and submission links.

#### Final Project
The course will culminate with the completion of a final project to be shared in class. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that builds off or is inspired by the concepts explored during the semester. For the final project you are expected to present a project proposal, create a working prototype to share for peer feedback, and present a completed final project to our class. 

### Grading
Assignments will be evaluated on timeliness, completeness, and engagement with the course materials to explore ways of expressing your own points of view (adapted from [source](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1464145/pages/grading-rubric-for-reading-responses)). I’ll create a private, individual Google Doc for each student to share feedback and evaluations.

**Photography experiments and reflections** are worth four (4) points, one (1) point for each of the following:
- The exercise addresses the creative prompt;
- demonstrates evidence of experimentation with results that are distinct from the examples and other projects;
- reflects on your resulting images and your experience of making them (e.g. What does/do the image/s show? What qualities do you like best? Consider framing, lighting, composition, and content, etc. What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the image/s? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?);
- is submitted on time.
- For any assignment that uses code, not properly citing code sources is grounds for receiving a zero (0) on the assignment. For more information, see the statement below on the Use of Free and Open Source Materials Including Code.

**Written reading responses** are worth four (4 points), one (1) point for each of the following:
- The response addresses the reading prompt;
- includes a position, opinion, and/or proposal that does not merely summarize what others have said, but represents your own thoughts even if they are tentative;
- includes at least one (1) question to bring to our group for discussion;
- is submitted on time.

**Late assignments**: weekly assignments will be accepted up to one (1) week late for partial credit.  

The final project is expected to be completed in three stages (proposal, prototype, and implementation and presentation). Specific grading criteria for each stage will be provided later in the semester.

**Final course evaluation** will be based on participation and attendance, and the completion of all assignments, including the final project, according to this breakdown:

- 30% Participation and attendance
- 25% Photography experiments and reflections (10 * 2.5%)
- 25% Written reading responses (10 * 2.5%)
- 20% Final project (5% proposal, 5% prototype, 10% project and presentation)

This class uses the standard A through F letter grading system, and grades will be determined according to this criteria:
92.5 - 100% A, 
90.0 - 92.5% A-, 
87.5 - 90% B+, 
82.5 - 87.5% B, 
80 - 82.5% B-, 
77.5 - 80% C+,
72.5 - 77.5% C, 
70 - 72.5% C-,
67.5 - 70% D+,
62.5 - 67.5% D,
60 - 62.5% D-, and
0 - 60% F

In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfactory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. There are some additional grades: P for Pass and  W for Withdrawal—which are granted administratively. Please note that IMA majors need a C or higher to satisfy their IMA requirements, i.e. receiving a D will not count for credit towards the IMA major.

### Statements
#### Academic Integrity / Statement of Principle
Excerpt from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts [Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks), please read the full text for additional information:

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s original work as if it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: a sequence of words quoted without quotation marks, a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work, ideas, sound recordings, computer data, or images composed or created by someone else.

Students are expected to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional artists, scholars, and writers do. Giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity; plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud.

#### Use of Free and Open Source Materials Including Code
You must cite the source of any material/code you use with the exception of examples specifically provided by the instructor or demonstrated for the course. Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines:
- **Check the license**. When using others' code, pay attention to the license under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and requirements of those licenses. Descriptions of common licenses, and their requirements, can be found at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/). Some licenses may require permission. If you are confused or aren’t sure how to credit code, ask one of the course instructors and make your best good faith effort. Not properly citing code sources is grounds for receiving a 0 on an assignment.
- **Use libraries**. The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.
- **Be careful**. It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their sketch or artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. Assignments professors give in new media arts courses are often similar; you may also discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should be careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a poetic experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others' code, is to make it your own. It should be clear that downloading an artwork from someone's p5 account or GitHub and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. And doing so without proper citation would be outright plagiarism.

Course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UjdDrXUMKgNjIiee9d2WeyV1Z8V1RfBEElkzWKXvbk) (Spring 2020) at New York University and Golan Levin’s [Interactivity and Computation Course](http://cmuems.com/2018/60212f/syllabus/academic-integrity/) (Fall 2018) at Carnegie Mellon University.

#### Accessibility
Please feel free to contact me about ways this class can be more accessible to you. Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the [Moses Center for Students with Disabilities](https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-accessibility.html) at 212-998-4980 for further information.

#### Counseling and Wellness
Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, I encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 [NYU Wellness Exchange](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/wellness-exchange.html) 212-443-9999. Free counseling sessions are provided.

#### Title IX
Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender.  Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link: [Title IX at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html).

#### Use of Electronic Devices
Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. This includes recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.
