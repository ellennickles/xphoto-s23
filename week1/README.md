# Week 1 • What is photography?

>The enemy of photography is the convention, the fixed rules of "how to do." The salvation of photography comes from the experiment. ([Lászlo Moholy-Nagy](https://photographyandvision.com/2021/03/15/monday-photography-inspiration-laszlo-moholy-nagy/), 1940)

## Questions
- In what ways can we start to describe photography?
- How do photographs function in our lives?
- How has photography changed since it started?
- What does experimental mean in this course?

## Assignment due Tues Jan 31
Bring to class:
- **USB to USB-C adapter** • If your computer only has USB-C ports, then you will need a **USB to USB-C adapter** to connect a Logitech webcam. **Please note: your adapter must be able to transmit data as well as power the camera.** These are also available from the ER, but they can be in high demand and sometimes unavailable to check out. Consider sharing with your classmates or purchasing your own: packs of 2 for ~$10 or less are frequently available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Adapter-Compatible-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B07BS8SRWH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=19JSU1Q8TES9N&keywords=USB%2BC%2Bto%2BUSB%2BAdapter%2Bjsaux&qid=1674232278&s=electronics&sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bto%2Busb%2Badapter%2Bjsaux%2Celectronics%2C65&sr=1-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVlJBRTVLWlNCMEw1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTI0ODY2M1QzQVFRQ09ZT05ETiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzMxNjUzMkpXTVMwWUFYWkhMQiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1).

## Assignment due night of Wed Feb 1 
[How to get full credit on weekly assignments.](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23#grading) 

### PART 1 • SET UP
- **Blog** • Make sure that you have a blog or website set up for this course to post and share your homework (a Google Doc, Notion, etc., will work too). If you’re not sure what platform to use, please reach out to me for help.
- **p5** • Create a free [p5 web editor account](https://editor.p5js.org/) (if you don’t already have one).
- **Miro** • Create a free [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/) (you can use any email address).

### PART 2 • SELECT & EXPERIMENT & REFLECT
- Select a photograph that you did not take but enjoy looking at or is of the type of imagery that you would like to know more about. Write a blog post, include the image, and describe what you see in the work. What does the image show? Does it tell a story? What qualities do you like best? What does it express? What choices did the photographer make to achieve these impressions and expressions? Why do you imagine the photograph was created? 
- Experiment: try to recreate the image with Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion text-to-image model. I recommend using the DreamStudio platform that we used in class and consulting the resources (all linked above). Remember that it's just an experiment! Reflect on the process. What inputs / settings were useful (or not) toward achieving your goal? In your opinion, can text-to-image generators make photographs?
- Be prepared to share and talk about the images in our next class. 

### PART 3 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kxEfgxvYHdQftZY_MBux-shgFjxjFRff) & RESPOND
- [The Rules](http://manifestos.mombartz.com/immaculate-heart-college-art-department-rules/) by [Sister Corita Kent](https://www.corita.org/) (1967-1968)
- [The Photographer’s Right](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kxEfgxvYHdQftZY_MBux-shgFjxjFRff) by Bert P. Krages II (2016)
- [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index) 
- Our class engages in experimental practices and also provides space to share our work, engage with that of others, and cultivate ways of collaboratively providing feedback to promote awareness and discovery in our creative practices (i.e. what creative decisions are we making). We’ll talk more about this in class next week. To get started, based on the readings above and on your own experience during our recent workshop and elsewhere, in the same blog post write about ways to foster a class community in which it is safe to experiment with ideas and materials, as well as to share our results with one another.
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

## Prepare for Weeks 4-5 
- Starting Tues Feb 14, we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last minute if you need to order anything.
- Gather the following materials:
    - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
    - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
    - Solderless breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
    - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
    - The [ITP/IMA Shop](https://shop.itp.io/) has some Arduinos and accessories available to check out
- Install the following app:
    - [Arduino IDE v2.0 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (older versions should also work)
- Configure and test the IDE with your Arduino:
   - [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-avr)
   - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-samd)
