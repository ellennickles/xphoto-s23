# Week 7 • Networked Images 2

>...the networked image is data, that is: visual information to be analysed and remapped to new contexts via algorithms. (Daniel Rubenstein and Katrina Sluis, "[A Life More Photographic; Mapping the Networked Image](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299854265_A_Life_More_Photographic_Mapping_The_Networked_Image)," 2008)

## Questions

- What is the difference between a series and a sequence of images?
- Is anything at stake when algorithms sort, label, and identify images?
- What are the ways in which images exist in relationship to one another online?

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT

- Curate a collection of at least (10) images found on the Internet. **Use a
  different method from the in-class exercise.** Be intentional and critical
  about why you are selecting the images and how you arrange them. How are the
  images related to one another? How does how the images are labeled,
  categorized, sorted, filtered, and/or accessed online produce meaning? What
  about the [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) of image files
  that we might not normally see? Will the collection be a sequence or a series?
- Possible inspiration from examples in the class [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO)
- Not sure which images to include in your collection? Refer to [Is it alive? On
  seeing what is right in front of you...](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/is-it-alive.md)
  by Joanne Dugan.
- Post the images on your blog. Configure them as you see fit for
  the work on your blog. How does grouping these particular images alter or
  extend their meanings when they are presented together instead of
  individually? Write a short reflection on your process and
  results. What do the images show? Why do you like the image? What qualities
  do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))?
  If you're working in color, how are you considering color choices? What did
  you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the
  experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising,
  enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bp6ZJ3krohBmhxB699nj1edjueV8w-EO) & RESPOND

- Read the Preface, Introduction, and Chapter 3 of _Photomontages_ by Dawn Ades,
  2021 (content notice: nudity).
- We're moving into a new unit on automation and taking some cues from
  pioneering photomontage artists, especially the
  [Surrealists](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/dada-and-surrealism/xdc974a79:surrealism/v/the-case-for-surrealism-the-art-assignment-pbs-digital-studios).
  Read for the historical context and to identify _how and why_ the artists
  were playing with photographic fragments. What guided their choices of subject
  matter? List the techniques the artists used to create photomontages,
  e.g. disruption of scale...and what else does Ades mention? What did the
  artists intend to express working in this way?
- Select an image from the reading, or find a photomontage online or
  out in the world, and analyze it terms of your answers to the questions above.
- If it helps, use the [Questions for
  Discovery](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/questions-for-discovery.md),
  [Looking at Photographs](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/looking-at-photographs.md),
  and/or [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s23/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md)
  to get started.
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.
